CONFLUENCE SCORING:
Before finalizing your signal, rate each factor (0-100) based on how strongly it SUPPORTS your chosen signal:
- 0 = Factor opposes the signal or is irrelevant
- 50 = Neutral / Mixed signals
- 100 = Factor strongly confirms the signal

Factors to score:
1. **trend_alignment**: Multi-timeframe trend confluence (short/medium/long align with signal direction)
2. **momentum_strength**: RSI, MACD, momentum oscillators supporting the signal
3. **volume_support**: Volume profile confirms the move (buying volume for BUY, selling for SELL)
4. **pattern_quality**: Chart patterns, candlestick formations, swing structure quality
5. **support_resistance_strength**: Proximity and strength of S/R levels supporting the trade setup

CRITICAL: Provide EXACTLY ONE signal. Never say "CLOSE then HOLD" or "BUY followed by SELL". Make only the immediate action decision.

=== TREND STRENGTH GUIDELINES (Advisory - You Decide) ===
These are GUIDELINES, not hard rules. Use your judgment based on overall confluence.

ADX + CHOPPINESS ASSESSMENT:
- ADX < 20 AND Choppiness > 50: ⚠️ CAUTION - Weak trend + choppy market. Requires 4+ strong confluences to trade.
- ADX < 20 but Choppiness < 50: Potential trend emerging (ADX lags). Trade allowed with strong confirmation.
- ADX 20-25: Developing trend. Standard 3+ confluences required.
- ADX > 25: Strong trend environment. Full confidence range available.

CHOPPINESS INDEX CONTEXT:
- Choppiness > 61.8: Ranging market - trend-following strategies may underperform
- Choppiness < 38.2: Trending market - breakouts/trend continuation favored
- Choppiness 38-62: Transitional - exercise caution

NOTE: You may OVERRIDE these guidelines if you have exceptionally strong conviction (e.g., major news catalyst, 5+ confluences, extreme oversold/overbought). When overriding, explicitly state your reasoning.

POSITION SIZING FORMULA (calculate before finalizing):
- Base size = confidence / 100 (e.g., 75 confidence = 0.75 base)
- If timeframe_alignment = "MIXED": reduce by 0.20 (e.g., 0.75 - 0.20 = 0.55)
- If timeframe_alignment = "DIVERGENT": reduce by 0.35 (e.g., 0.75 - 0.35 = 0.40)
- In weak trend environments (ADX < 20): consider smaller sizes
- Final position_size = max(0.10, calculated_value)

MACRO TIMEFRAME CONFLICT:
If the 365D macro trend CONTRADICTS the trade direction:
- Exercise extra caution and require stronger confirmation
- Consider waiting for better R/R setups
If both 365D and Weekly macro conflict: HOLD is strongly recommended unless catalyst is exceptional.

TRADING SIGNALS & CONFIDENCE:
- BUY (70-100 confidence): Strong multi-indicator confluence + volume confirmation + clear SL/TP + minimum 2:1 R/R preferred
- SELL (70-100 confidence): Strong multi-indicator confluence + volume confirmation + clear SL/TP + minimum 2:1 R/R preferred
- HOLD (any confidence <70): Mixed signals, weak trend, conflicting indicators, low volume, or insufficient setup quality
- CLOSE: Exit position when SL/TP hit, signal reversal, or thesis invalidated
- UPDATE: Adjust existing position SL/TP when market structure improves

RISK/REWARD GUIDELINES:
- R/R < 1.5: Very unfavorable - strongly consider HOLD
- R/R 1.5-2.0: Borderline - only trade with exceptional confluence (4+)
- R/R >= 2.0: Standard acceptable quality
- R/R >= 2.5: Strong setup - preferred for counter-trend trades

RISK MANAGEMENT (Stop Loss & Take Profit):
LONG trades:
- SL: Below swing low + 1x ATR buffer (max 2-3% from entry) | Example: Entry $100, Swing Low $97, ATR $1 → SL $96
- TP: Key resistance levels, Fibonacci (0.618/0.786/1.0), previous highs | Multiple targets: TP1=1.5R, TP2=2.5R, TP3=3.5R

SHORT trades:  
- SL: Above swing high + 1x ATR buffer (max 2-3% from entry) | Example: Entry $100, Swing High $103, ATR $1 → SL $104
- TP: Key support levels, Fibonacci (0.382/0.236/0.0), previous lows | Multiple targets: TP1=1.5R, TP2=2.5R, TP3=3.5R

Mandatory: All trades require stops based on technical levels (not arbitrary %), accounting for ATR volatility, positioned to invalidate thesis if hit.'''
